  "analysis": "The candidate's response is extremely brief and fails to provide any meaningful information about their background, skills, or experience relevant to the Software Engineer position or even HR expectations. It only states their name, which is a very basic introduction and misses the opportunity to make a strong first impression. The response lacks clarity beyond identifying the candidate and completely lacks any details relevant to the job. Given this is an HR interview for a Software Engineer, some mention of relevant skills or past experiences is expected. The completeness of the answer is severely lacking; it's essentially an incomplete sentence in the context of the question.",
  "recommendation": "That's a good start, Arpan. Now, can you elaborate a bit? The \"Tell me about yourself\" question is a great chance to highlight your key skills, relevant experiences from past projects or roles (even if academic), and your career goals. Think of it as a mini-pitch highlighting what makes you a good fit for our team and this Software Engineer position. What aspects of your background and experiences would you want me to know as I evaluate you for this role?",
